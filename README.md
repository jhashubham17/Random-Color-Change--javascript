The Random Color Change Project is a simple JavaScript application that allows you to create a fun and interactive experience by changing the background color of an element randomly. When the user hovers over the designated element, the background color will change to a random RGB color. This project is perfect for adding an engaging touch to your web page or as a learning exercise for working with JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
